            <h1 class = "display-6">about me</h1>
            <p>I'm a first-generation student currently pursuing a bachelors degree at the University of Southern California 
                with a major in Computer Science, and minor in Sociology. I'm enthusiastic
                about merging both fields together, and ultimately using technology to promote social change. ü´∂üèæ
            </p>
            <p>I'm also native to downtown, Los Angeles. Whenever I'm not at USC, you can usually find me exploring 
                restaurants around downtown that serve cuisines from Guatemala. My favorite dish consists of 
                fried, rippened plantains submerged in sweet, tangy mole. üíö

            <p>FindUSCHousingüè† (Spring 2023)</p>
            <p>I collaborated with six classmates in CSCI 201
                to build a dynamic, full stack website called "FindUSCHousing." Our goal was to create 
                a platform where current USC students can sublease their units to other students, 
                or search for housing being subleased by other students. While 
                we never officially released our product for public use, it was a great learning experience. We used 
                html, css, bootstrap, and cookies for the front-end. For the back-end, we used Java servlets and an SQL database.
                Below, are some pictures of the various pages my team built. I worked on implementing the front-end and back-end of the profile page, 
                which displays the user's personal information like their name, email address, and any rentals they have saved 
                or posted on the site.
